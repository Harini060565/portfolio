<h3>Unakum enakum</h3>
<p><h4>It was a such a beautiful love story. I had watched around several times since my childhood. </p>
    
    <p>everyone in the movie played well. </h4></p>

<h3>Tourist family</h3>
<p><h4>It was a wonderful experience to watch this movie. It was so fuuny as well as emotional which we can able to relate in todays world</p>
<p>i would recommand this movie to watch as its super funny character played by youngest child of hero</p></h4>

<h3>Sita ramam</h3>
<p><h4>It beautifully shares the pain that is holded by the army officers family. Their love was incredible and so emotional.</p>
<p>everybody would cry in the climax and actor & actress played beautifully and made justice to their role</p></h4>
